## Awesome Blockchain Development, Applications and SE Research

For now, this repository only collects GitHub repos related to:
* ***Frameworks*** that helps the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications (a.k.a dApp) on Ethereum.
* ***dApps*** that relies on smart contracts on Ethereum.

and repos that are:
* ***Popular***: receives a number of stars or forks.
* ***Well-maintained***: has been updated within a year.

Research papers that are related to Software Engineering Research in dApps and Smart Contracts are also included. 

This list will be frequently updated and other types of repos are to be included. 

## Frameworks

### [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)

Truffle suite is the most popular development framework for Ethereum Smart Contracts. It provides easy tools to help create, develop, deploy, migrate and test smart contracts along with a virtual blockchain environment.  

This framework is open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/)

### [Aragon](https://aragon.org/)

Aragon is a platform with a build-in so-called AragonOS, which offers the service to manage how applications accesses the underlying resources within smart contracts. 

Developers and users can easily create protocols and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) on top of AragonOS and manage them on Aragon platform. 

Aragon is open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/aragon)

### [Squeezer](https://squeezer.io/)

Squeezer is a platform that empowers new-entry blockchain developers to build serverless dApps simply as dead.

Squeezer is open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/SqueezerIO)

### [Embark](https://embark.status.im/)

Embark is a framework that allows you to easily develop and deploy Decentralized Applications (DApps).

Embark is open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/embark-framework)

## dApps (Decentralized Application)

### [Augur](https://www.augur.net/)

Augur is a decentralized oracle and peer to peer protocol for prediction markets. Augur is a set of smart contracts written in Solidity that can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.

Augur project is open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/AugurProject)

### [slock.it](https://slock.it/)

slock.it is a company focusing on the blockchain solution of Internet of Things (IoT). They designs a protocol that allows IoT devices to take part in the network of blockchain (i.e. Ethereum) and share and retrieve trustworthy data without trust to a central institution.  

slock.it implements their protocol as INCUBED (in3) and open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/slockit)

### [Giveth](https://giveth.io/)

Giveth is re-engineering charitable giving, by creating an entirely free, open-source platform, built on the Ethereum Blockchain. This system cuts out bureaucracy and enables makers to create a high level of transparency and accountability towards Givers. For example: At any point until the moment funds are locked, a Giver can decide to withdraw them.

Giveth is open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Giveth)

### [DemocracyEarth](https://democracy.earth/)

Democracy Earth Foundation is building free, open source software for incorruptible blockchain-based decision-making(voting) within institutions of all sizes, from the most local involving two people to the most global involving all of us. 

DemocracyEarth is open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth)
